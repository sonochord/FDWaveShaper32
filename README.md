# FDWaveShaper32

FDWaveShaper32 is an audio processing plugin designed to offer sound shaping and enhancement capabilities. Itâ€™s partly a mastering tool, combining multiple signal-processing techniques into a single interface. This project was developed in 2024 as part of an MSc in Sound and Music Computing at Maynooth University, Ireland.

## Features

- **High-Quality Signal Processing**: 4x oversampling on the effected signal path.
- **Customisable Waveshaping**: Unique waveshaping algorithm for harmonic enhancement.
- **Tonal Balance Control**: Incorporates a Tilt EQ.
- **High Frequency Taming**: Variable lowpass filter for smooth high-frequency attenuation.
- **Parallel Dynamics Processing**: Two fixed parallel compression settings.
- **Clipping**: Final-stage clipper for peak limiting and saturation.
- **User Interface**: User-friendly GUI for efficient workflow and real-time adjustments.

## Technical Implementation

FDWaveShaper32 is built using the JUCE framework and developed in C++, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and high performance.
